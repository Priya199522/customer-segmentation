# customer-segmentation
• Collected a customer dataset from the web and performed thorough data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare for analysis and modeling.

• Conducted data analysis and visualization with a focus on loan defaulters, comparing them across multiple features using correlation heatmaps and other visual tools.

• Identified that credit card usage, other debts, and debt-to-income ratio are highly correlated with customer defaults.

• Built and evaluated three machine learning models — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) — to predict defaults.

• Found that the Logistic Regression model performed best, achieving the highest accuracy of 70.89%.
