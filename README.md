# customer-segmentation


• The dataset is collected from web.
• The data was cleaned and processed and analysed before EDA.
• Data analysis and visualization done on defaulters by comparing with different 
  parameters of dataset and by using heatmap shows that credit card, other debt 
  and debt income ratio are highly correlated to defaulters.
• For prediction purpose I have used three models Logistic Regression, Random 
  Forest and Knearest Neighbours the outcome of which that logistic regression 
  model gives the highest accuracy with 70.89%.
